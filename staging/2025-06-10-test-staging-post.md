# Test Staging Post

This is a test post that lives directly in the staging directory.

## Purpose

This post is used to test the staging preview system:

- It's a real blog post with proper front matter
- It lives in the `staging/` directory
- It will be built as part of the staging collection
- It appears in the preview site

## Content

This is just sample content to verify that:

1. Jekyll can build staging posts
2. The staging collection works
3. Posts appear in the preview deployment

When this works, we know the staging system is functioning correctly!
